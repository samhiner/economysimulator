# The Economy Simulator
To run the code locally:
* Download and install MAMP from https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/ (if you are using Linux, LAMP should suffice as an alternative)
* Place all of the files into the htdocs folder in MAMP
* Start the MAMP server and type "localhost/MAMP" in your browser.
* Once you have reached the website, click on the link titled phpMyAdmin.
* Click import on the taskbar at the top and import the mysql database [insert MYSQL database here].
* Go to "localhost" in your browser.
* Profit. 

Note: This is only for running the game on your machine. If you want to run it on a server, you could use freewha.com. You would just upload the files and use their version of phpMyAdmin to upload the database. Also, you can get a free domain to use for your freewha site with freenom.com.
